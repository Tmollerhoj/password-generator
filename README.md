# Password Generator

## Description

In this project I create a randomized password generator that promts the user for certain password perameters and then follows those perameters when creating the password. The perameters used were:
- Password length
- Use of uppercase letters
- Use of special characters
- Use of numbers

## Motivation and Learning

I wanted to make this project to challenge me to think about how to incorporate prompt() and queryselector(). While working on this project I also learned how to use confirm(), Math.floor(), and Math.random(). 

## Usage

To use simply load the page and answer the prompts. Once you're ready click on the "Generate Password" button to create a random password that follows the perameters you've set. Click again to get another completely random password as many times as you like.
